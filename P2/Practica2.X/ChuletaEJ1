12.1.1.6 Asynchronous Transmission Set-up:

1. Initialize the SPBRGH, SPBRG register pair and
the BRGH and BRG16 bits to achieve the desired
baud rate (see Section 12.3 ?EUSART Baud
Rate Generator (BRG)?).

2. Enable the asynchronous serial port by clearing
the SYNC bit and setting the SPEN bit.

3. If 9-bit transmission is desired, set the TX9 control bit. A set ninth data bit will indicate that the 8
Least Significant data bits are an address when
the receiver is set for address detection.

4. Enable the transmission by setting the TXEN
control bit. This will cause the TXIF interrupt bit
to be set.

5. If interrupts are desired, set the TXIE interrupt
enable bit of the PIE1 register. An interrupt will
occur immediately provided that the GIE and
PEIE bits of the INTCON register are also set.

6. If 9-bit transmission is selected, the ninth bit
should be loaded into the TX9D data bit.

7. Load 8-bit data into the TXREG register. This
will start the transmission.
