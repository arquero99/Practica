The A/D module has four registers. These registers are:
• A/D Result High Register (ADRESH)
• A/D Result Low Register (ADRESL)
• A/D Control Register0 (ADCON0)
• A/D Control Register1 (ADCON1)
The ADCON0 register, shown in Figure 23-1, controls the operation of the A/D module. The
ADCON1 register, shown in Figure 23-2, configures the functions of the port pins. The port pins
can be configured as analog inputs (AN3 and AN2 can also be the voltage references) or as digital I/O.

When the A/D conversion is complete, the result is loaded into the ADRES register, the
GO/DONE bit (ADCON0<2>) is cleared, and A/D interrupt flag bit, ADIF, is set.
After the A/D module has been configured as desired, the selected channel must be acquired
before the conversion is started. The analog input channels must have their corresponding TRIS
bits selected as an input. To determine acquisition time, see Subsection 21.4 “A/D Acquisition
Requirements.” After this acquisition time has elapsed the A/D conversion can be started. The
following steps should be followed for doing an A/D conversion:
1. Configure the A/D module:
• Configure analog pins / voltage reference / and digital I/O (ADCON1)
• Select A/D input channel (ADCON0)
• Select A/D conversion clock (ADCON0)
• Turn on A/D module (ADCON0)
2. Configure A/D interrupt (if desired):
• Clear the ADIF bit
• Set the ADIE bit
• Set the GIE bit
3. Wait the required acquisition time.
4. Start conversion:
• Set the GO/DONE bit (ADCON0)
5. Wait for A/D conversion to complete, by either:
• Polling for the GO/DONE bit to be cleared
OR
• Waiting for the A/D interrupt
6. Read A/D Result register (ADRES), clear the ADIF bit, if required.
7. For next conversion, go to step 1 or step 2 as required. The A/D conversion time per bit is
defined as TAD. A minimum wait of 2TAD is required before next acquisition starts
